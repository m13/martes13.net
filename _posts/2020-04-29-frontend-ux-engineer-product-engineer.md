In the last couple months, I've been very active developing web applications.

First, I remade this website using [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie).

Today, I released my wife's project MVP [GreenCatPiano.com](https://greencatpiano.com) using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/).

In a future, I hope to release a new project called [ContingencyPlan.Online](https://contingencyplan.online/).

I'm glad to have shared these three projects in my Github as Open Source, while taking advantage of `github-pages` to host them.

That said, once code became simpler, what matters is the rest of the process, from the moment you have the idea to when finally someone comes back every day to use your product.
